Homework assignment #3 - Password Generator

# What did i do?

I have built a password generator that works by asking the user a series of questions to determine what characters they would like to include and how many characters they would like to include.

# What do i need to explain?

This was built by taking the user responses and creating an array of all of the characters. That array is they sampled for random values to build the password.
